68;Consulting;Accenture;4.0;They will pay you money as much as they give pressure;Too much overtime, the company forces employees through poppet TL & Manager to work on Saturday and Sunday. They don't pay you for that... Don't approve earned leaves. Don't add enough FTs... All Manager will put reason that you are working from home so why u need leave, why can't you work extra... Typical indian working mentality management even though most of them are US clients
69;Consulting;Accenture;3.0;Work culture there in my project is bit complex, people around is not ready to take changes, They don't want anyone to suggest them anything. They want to work as they want. Management is not reach directly if anything. They always come via via.;I have good team there. Job Security is high. They do not fire anyone, they keep changing the projects. Career growth is slow. No one will help you out with what you will get in appraisals, they keep saying you will get, but no response to what and how.
70;Consulting;Accenture;1.0;The work given was good. Coding involved. Good learning experience. The gifts given in the form of cash were good from leadership.;Lots of work pressure. Bad treatment from team lead and managers. They made us work 12-14 hours everyday. Even after that, team lead and managers would shout at employees
71;Consulting;Accenture;4.0;The amount of exposure to various tools, projects, people and also chance to learn new technologies is what excites always. You get your time off when needed, as u can say for my deal not sure of others. Company policies ascertains you to be in top at your work and life.;The bonus structure is not always conclusive. The number of levels and sub-levels are way too much. If you don't have a position in your deal, then you are stuck at same level for years provided you change the deal.
72;Consulting;Accenture;2.0;ESOP;The worst is the HR especially L&D team and other HR related team they are too slow to respond and don't bother about the employee and without any power, mangers treat them as they want against lower employee and senior managers are worst too to handle any employee grievances No job security, too much pressure and no communication
73;Consulting;Accenture;3.0;I have been with Accenture for the last 12 years, really sad to how the company has deteriorated over the years. With the new CEO, Accenture is not the same place it used to be. During Corona time last year (June - December) Accenture has fired thousands of employees in the name of poor performance. If you have any other offe;Firing people in the name of performance. The shortsightedness of the higher management. first fire thousands of employees & then high like crazy.
74;Consulting;Accenture;4.0;Excellent projects, new technologies to work on, work from home option;They have a concept of letting senior persons from onsite locations even when they are technically incapable to lead teams which I found very stupid. Since these people lack business knowledge as well Accenture is also loosing key projects as client also is finding this loophole in Accenture. In Accenture India regionalism is very
75;Consulting;Accenture;4.0;As compare to other service service company they were good at payment and work life balance is good but again depends on project to project. but management is more oriented towards PPT rather then real technologies. All big big idea were on paper only.;Management is more oriented towards the PPT culture rather then interested in real technologies implementation which means no real scope for technologies people and so if someone technologies oriented then chances of growing is very less.
76;Consulting;Accenture;5.0;The overall work experience while working from office as well as home with respect to the work culture, work-life balance, and the scope for learning and development is excellent. I would highly recommend any candidate be it a fresher or experienced to work in Accenture and experience the beauty of work in the company.;I would like to suggest the company to slightly better the compensation.
77;Consulting;Accenture;4.0;Supportive team lead. Good work environment.;Salary hike is poor. Too much pressure of work. Long shift hours.

Huge training and learning opportunities;Job security not good as every year you have to prove else good bye. Work life balance. Skill upgrade not utilised in the organisation. Delay career growth.

83;Consulting;Accenture;4.0;Overall good company. But if you get into any project it becomes difficult to change or learn something new. Work timing can be flexible. Job security is very good and you can keep working for 8-10 years at same place if you want to. Overall compensation is good, but variable pay should be less.;Management is normal, not bad, but can be better. HRs are usually of no help, n employees get tired of reaching out to them.
84;Consulting;Accenture;4.0;i like the work environment and the accenture policies.;The is no opportunity given , even after you upscale yourself by doing hands-on work in your personal time. Managers never give the opportunity , even if they do , the other teams are reluctant to welcome you as a member. You have to work on your skills and find new job elsewhere , but never in accenture.

There is no job security, management is under huge pressure from HR to identify bottom 10% performers. There is no standard process in the appraisals,. if you have god father you can survive if;Working culture, regional politics, favouritism, few people working under same supervisor and same MD for longer time though they are not great performers but they belong to same language speaking. HR management process in this company is completely big mess. There are so many groups in HR and they don't have proper communication between them. Their job is to fire today and hire next day.
87;Consulting;Accenture;5.0;Accenture provides a better job security and good platforms to learn/cross skill into new technologies.;It would be more helpful if there is a good and easy path for every employee to search for existing opportunities inside organization. It may be in function but someone like me who is new to the organization and couldn't find it in 1.8 years then it should be something to think about.
88;Consulting;Accenture;5.0;Flexible to work. Everyone are very good at team work. Friendly environment.;No increment of salary
89;Consulting;Accenture;5.0;Accenture is good company. It gives lot of benefits to their employee in bad time or in good time as well. Job security is very excellent. Surely want to work again with accenture. We get salary always on time, increment bonus system is very awesome.;Accenture treats there employees as a school student. While working in Accenture you will feel like you are still a school student and management treat with you like a teacher or principal. Management sucks very partial and very political approach they have. Even Free food facilities are not there.

91;Consulting;Accenture;1.0;Nothing to like here. Work environment is only based on relationship with supervisor. If you're good with them, everything will be good- job security, benefits, awards many more;Efforts are not considered. HRs won't respond, they only act as per the management. Though there're so many opportunities inside the organization, they won't let to utilize. They target people who make less noise and women employees when it comes to cost cutting.

100;Consulting;Accenture;1.0;Cloud initiative is by far the most engaging activity that accenture has started investing in.;- people engagement is poor and pay out is worst for employees who stay long term.

106;Consulting;Accenture;5.0;Accenture is the best company to work with. As a fresher, I have found that Accenture has a professional and friendly working environment.

People are so supportive and helping, as there were so man;As of now, there is nothing I can say. They all are good.
107;Consulting;Accenture;3.0;My work experience is not good in COVID-19. Accenture support me with my job as it has given me a very long LOA because of my location that is Mumbai and I am from Delhi-NCR. But my Manager/supervisor did not supported me with my career growth as I was asking for there support since August 2020 but they provided me laptop on 29 Oct 2;The Manager/supervisor are not supportive specially at the time of COVID-19 when we are from different location and was asked to return to our home due to lock down without any help or laptop and they neither change our location.

109;Consulting;Accenture;1.0;Seriously worse.... IJP roles are coming up but leads say that they are all pre booked and IJP requirement mail comes just for name sake... Don't know what's going on.... Ask for IJP and threatening starts where our scores are lowered so we enter PIP and then we are fired without any prior notice...;Every month process changes.... And when asked to management they say it's new agreement with clients....I think cleint and accenture has no work rather than singing impossible agreements.... Hurts personal feeling of every individual everyday with something new asked to be done which is impossible to achieve....
110;Consulting;Accenture;1.0;Instead of supporting Accenture is laying off their employees like other IT companies by saying that they don't need their service anymore and they don't have future opportunites for their employees. There is only one difference between Accenture and other IT companies who are laying off their employees is just that, Accenture is lay;Project, culture, are very bad
111;Consulting;Accenture;4.0;Good work environment and scope of learning is more;The employee who join as a third party is not having good salary, bonus, internet /light bill expenses and career growth.

112;Consulting;Accenture;3.0;New skills.;There is no job security. management is threatening using big missile PIP (PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM). Every year PIP is mandatory and 5% employees will get PIP in Accenture. They have fired 15 thousand employees with 6 months salary in India in 2020 due covid situation. No salary hike for existing employees.
113;Consulting;Accenture;5.0;Best place for career growth and learning. Increment and bonuses are also good if you are a performer. in SAP they have good projectes(most of them are Implementation). You will be recognised and will be given opportunity if you are performing resource.;Some time you feel insecure about job security. Specially in Corona time & if you are in bench

Salary is decent but career growth is slow.
115;Consulting;Accenture;3.0;Skill development is good, you will get various opportunities to upskill yourself. Job Security is there, I have seen people working there for a long period of time.;Work-life balance is worst that depends on your project but still, I have seen most of my colleagues working day-night without having any personal life. Compensation is also worst, too much dirty politics.
116;Consulting;Accenture;1.0;Nothing;TL and AM will treat you like animals. There is no work life balance. We also have to work on SATURDAY and no extra money is given. One of my colleagues got sick, she informed the AM that she is not well she might be covid postive as her mother had covid so she asked for leave but AM refused to give her leave. She said that we cannot give you leaves unless your test reports come.
117;Consulting;Accenture;4.0;Overall Accenture isa good place to work with be it learning opportunities, work exp, work culture, policies..;Recently realised one thing that if you compare your CTC( if you in Accenture for more than 4yrs) with any lateral hire than you will be far behind as Accenture is ready to hire a person with same skillset with 100% hike but can't give even 10% hike to their loyal existing Employees, which is really wrong.
118;Consulting;Accenture;3.0;As we know that Accenture is one of the best organization and it's culture is too good.;Some of the process have poor management and they guys are ruining Accenture name.
119;Consulting;Accenture;3.0;This used to be best place, but you need to be a politician to succeed in this now. Higher level management comes with lot of attitude and not approachable.;Lot of politics and senior leaders not approachable behaviour is seriously bad here. Lot of attitude shown by senior leadership shows the value mid level management.
120;Consulting;Accenture;5.0;Company policies is very good but will not applied on supervisor and above level of management. Perks and incentive is very low rate.Stretch on daily basis 2 to 3 hours buy after that no motivation and no promotion also iritation on everyday by supervisor .

126;Consulting;Accenture;1.0;nothing;Almost everything. Favoritism is the core for Growth. Arguing with your leads justifying your performance will do nothing. Position matters.

127;Consulting;Accenture;2.0;You will learn lot of new tools and technologies and keep you updated with latest trends and softwares;The people who are in higher levels doesn't know how to manage team, no comp offs for employees, no recognition for the work you have done.

142;Consulting;Accenture;3.0;Opportunities for learning. Shift allowences.;Health insurance is not good and co-pay is 10-20%. No work life balance. Shared model so won't be getting free time ever. Promotion takes time and hike is not good too. Very minimum onsite opportunities.
143;Consulting;Accenture;5.0;I have been working with Accenture solutions since sept 2017 it's nice place to grow personally and professionally. Good work environment and culture. They provide salary hikes and bonus for wfh. Employee safety is 1st preference for Accenture solutions pvt Ltd.;Salary hikes are decent and variable amounts are not 100% for employees.
144;Consulting;Accenture;3.0;While we worked in office it feels good but not in WFH;Am not blaming about all the deals. But in my deal and some other few deals I found lot of work pressure and don't even recognised for those. Benefits is clearly wiped out though you work really hard you will hate the compensation received from management is worst.
145;Consulting;Accenture;4.0;Its been 5 years in the organization and I have been identified as per my performance and benefited accordingly. The immediate manager is always there not only to hear our issues and concerns but also our ideas which can be implemented. Its been really good till date working with Accenture.;There should be more awareness regarding work life balance. The work life balance has been effected a lot after Covid situation as we are WFH all the time.
146;Consulting;Accenture;5.0;I have given around years to this organisation and it was the first ever company I got a chance to start my career with. It's been a great journey till now.

No Work-life balance when it comes to the releases and deliverables.
147;Consulting;Accenture;1.0;Salary;Though, salary is good in ACN but you are not going to earn for longer period of time because ACN SF leadership has become pathetic and they/HE (Atul Bakliwal) believes in firing veterans and hire worst people from outside and then again fire them after sometime.

150;Consulting;Accenture;4.0;Definitely Employee centric company;Shift timings are pathetic and even at WFH culture this has been enforced which can be avoidable keeping in mind the business we are into.

They provide rating based on how long a person is working for that project(means how much they got money from their client) but not as per the performance. Developers always work to complete the story(in Agile projects) . They never try to improve on their code quality and best practices.
1700;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;This is my first company and I love working here. I had three options in beginning of my career but I chose Capgemini and I have never regretted it. People are confused that CG doesn't has job safety, this is private sector and your performance matter to each and every company but in my experience, CG will give all the possible chances to prove yourself.;I think, it's project centric and subjective thing but I have lost my work-life balance since pandemic. That could have been handled much better
1701;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Work assignment based on skill. Work life balance. Some very good projects to grow.;Performance appraisals are based on number of years we spent in the company and not based on work done. Person doing great work are given default rating since some below average people completed 2-3 yrs in company
1702;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;The company has a great work culture and has good job security, Work life balance is also quite good.;The only issue with Capgemini is even after having good skills and doing a good work, you are not recognized, moreover the people who are close to manager get good appraisals, hike and promotion. Many good people leave just because the hike is very less.
1703;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;As a fresher it was a good opportunity working here. Learnt new technologies. Office environment is without politics (atleast it was for me). Team mates are helpful. Over all a bright experience being a fresher.;Salary is a big dislike.They pay less compared to other giants. There are no sick leaves. Development projects are less. Bench period is long for freshers.
1704;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;Complete freedom to work your way. Excellent work life balance. Superb Managers and leadership. Multiple options for learning and career enhancement. Employee friendly policies and meaningful concern for employees during illness.;Nothing in Particular.
1705;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;The job security, work culture is great. Learning opportunities are great. The laid back approach to strict clothing policies is one of the best things which make you comfortable at work. Overall a good company for upper senior level candidates;The career switch opportunities are not good as the change in BU isn't done easily. Very less attention given when it comes to a raise in position and salary. The reward and promotion process is quite random rather than looking at hard work. For instance I have been promoted when I did nothing and not promoted when I did more than expected (client appreciation).
1706;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;1.0;Yes Of Course They supported a lot through covid 19 but They hire on contract while telling a lie. I was hired for 6 Months and told me that I will be permanent but they terminate within 3 months only. They are just Playing with employees Life. I hate Capgemini Contract hiring Process. It should be ban they leave you when you don't h;Capgemini is burst only hire for third party payroll. Just striking everyone with the same stick. Destroying employees Life. Don't Go for Capgemini on third party. It will be cheated you suddenly when you don't have opportunity. So take care of such company.
1707;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Work-life balance is awesome really. Learning opportunities are also more. Follows all the enterprise level standards.;The only thing I faced is the way the appraisal's are given. To be frank that is only to the location where I was deployed. The managers are kind of greedy. Doesn't matter how good a person works, when it comes to appraising him, things will be different. That's the thing I don't like in them. Again it is only for the location I have worked (Gujarat)
1708;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;They have not done anything;The work environment is extremely unpleasant. There are no opportunities for growth, only people with contacts and practically no skills are able to secure good projects and on-site opportunities. Compensation distribution is not fair and is always biased, even towards people with same ratings. Even in team meetings, people can be se
1709;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;1.0;Nothing is good about the company. No process is followed. All defined processes are mould to gain profit and make employees life miserable. It is a genuine feedback, which all employees will agree.;Everything. Please reach out to known person who has been associated with this company, before accepting Capgemini offer. No hike , no growth in this company.
1710;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;Great work environment and culture to work in an organisation. Teammates are supportive and are like buddies. The management is transparent and we'll experienced. And the best thing is that there is no bond for this company;Salary is decent but career growth is slow
1711;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Capgemini is my 5th company and I am enjoying to work in Capgemini. I can manage both my professional and personal life in CG. Also I expand my knowledge in different technology in last 6 years. Thanks;Except the increment and salary there is no dislike point.
1712;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Teammates are supportive but management is not transparent. Ratings are not given as per you performance. Hikes are not that good.;There is a lot of politics and the Middle management is hypocritic. Hikes are good for nothing and rating are not based upon how you perform.
1713;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;1) Flexible time to work 2) Capgemini learning programs are good but you may miss them due to client work delivery 3) Good support to employees during Covid 4) Pulse feedback;1) one to one communication is missing or not mandatory in rating process 2) comparatively less hike and salary for employees
1714;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Good to learn new tools.;Managers dont know how to assign resources. No scope of career growth where your own onsite manager keeps targeting you instead of helping out in front of the client. Work environment is good when you are working with like-minded people from your team as they know the importance of the work but it's worse when micro-management starts.
1715;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;2.0;I don't see anything. They gave option to get the office chairs from office other than that I don't get to claim anything. And I am working 16 hours on daily basis. So I don't think they support much. But they are making lot of initiative.;I joined capgemini 2019 may, Later I was trained in mainframe(I got no other option). After training I was asked to work in PHP and mongodb out of blue. I spend lot of time and energy learning it. After 1.5 years again I was forced to work on mainframe.
1716;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Capgemini is a place where i got good opportunity to learn new things;As we are in work from home. We are not getting any shift allowance. And no proper backup for the person who is leaving the company. Lot of work load... I am working more than 14hrs every day and even in weekends without extra pay.
1717;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;Job security and recognition time to time.;Nothing much. World life balance compromises but that also depends on project to project. Out of 5 projects I worked in, in one project work life balance was hectic, for other four project the work life balance was good.
1718;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;job security is good. work culture is good. management is worst , not at all concerned about employees. company policies is average (3/5). overall experience is just good.;Teammates are good. training is good job security is good. career growth is less. Salary for freshers it is good but for experience is not good and forget about appraisal due to covid they stopped all appraisals. travel facility is good. Too much of politics. Learning for freshers it is good but for experience it is not good. inno
1719;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Job security is good. This company thinks alot about employees. Company policies are good you will get small amounts for every extra effort you made. The amount may not be big but still you will get something. Other things depends on your direct reporting manager and team members.;You may get linked to other projects and may have to help or work in other projects as well.
1720;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;I feel like Capgemini Is really great place to work and learn new with your work and achieve many things and really supportive all staff and organizations environment is very nice to work. I feel like I'm working with government sector not in private that much nice work environment with organizations and management peoples are really helpful and supportive.;I Never feel anything wrong in my till work experience with Capgemini.
1721;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Good work environment and culture. Teammates are supportive. Good infrastructure, cafeteria and place to chill at. Companies policies are good.;Very little opportunity for self growth, if you are starting as a fresher you would be paid veey little, no major increments will happen, learning curve goes down after 1 years, also there is no work life balance.
1722;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;We have good work environment. Apart from it team mates are really good and supportive. Company policies are really for working on flexible hours.;Salary hikes and yearly appraisals are really low. Even projects have bond of 18 months so that you can not switch your project with in the company even.
1723;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Work job security is fair. Client interactions are also ample. But work life balance is not maintained.;No work life balance. Career growth opportunities are stifled.
1724;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;2.0;Only Job security is there. There no other pros;Some teammates are like have very little knowledge. Training is like a joke.No career growth, No satisfactory appraisal, too much politics. The work env is very toxic. innovation is just a tool to cut down your ratting. Very poor work-life balance.
1725;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;Capgemini is the best place to work for any employee. The company always stands with the employees and it has been proved during this Pandemic that started last year. Capgemini provided moral support and job security throughout the year. It's always our pleasure to work for a company like Capgemini.;Salary hike is less but that is not a problem as it provides job security.
1726;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Good environment for work,good policies for work culture.Good organisation for experience ,fair appraisals. Great cafeteria and environment for employees.;Salary and appraisals are good,growth is a bit time taking may vary person to person or domain to domain.There is 2 year bond period which you cant resign.
1727;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Skill based trainings;No job security,Once you are on bench RMG will not find positions suitable to your skills.You will be expected to work on hectic non technical projects and even to relocate outside your location despite having many positions at your base location
1728;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Work life balance is good.There are lots of extra curricular activities on Friday that helps in keeping mind refresh.Compensation and appraisals are not that good.;Carrier growth and appraisals are not that good.
1729;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;Capgemini is one of the service based company to work with latest technologies and multiple domains which includes Automobile, Finance etc. You get a great exposure to different roles and responsibilities making you a good architect or manager depending on your choices.;I have liked the company , but sometimes increments are the issue if you are in higher pay scale.
1730;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Job security.. Nice place for poor or average performers, as you will not loose the job easily.;Selfish management who is not bothered about employee growth and work life balance. Over commitment from management to the client, lack of vision and team work.
1731;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;The unity of the company is very good.My colleaugues come from various culturebackgounds. and we work happily in collaboration,haven't faced any partiality issue;Growth is slow, workpresure is somtimes hight. were employess tend working for 12 hours and sometimes on weekends.

1733;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;1) Even after when wuhan virus pandemic hit the world all other IT companies started laying off but Capgemstood with their employees and secured our jobs. 2) The work culture is employee friendly and friendly colleagues. 3) There is big gymnasium for employees and lot of food options in the cafeteria and good sports facilities available.;1) Projects are challenging sometimes so work life balance is hampered 2) Appraisal should be given as per performance not for sake of it.
1734;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Company is very supportive during pandemaic. On time they provided wfh and providing salary on time. More important during tough time give job security is an important things.;It not about disliking the company...there should be over time compensation for employee who work beyond their shift. There should be career growth opportunity like provide employee certification programe for learning skill and updation.
1735;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Good work environment and culture. Teammates are supportive and the management is transparent. There is a huge cafeteria and gaming arcade for chilling. Company policies are good, appraisals are fair and they give good salary hike and bonus every year.;There is a lot of politics and the management doesn‚Äôt address our issues. Salary is decent but career growth is slow. There is a bond of 2 years before which you cannot resign. On the job training is not given to new joinees.
1736;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;1.0;Not employee friendly. Worst on compensation and employee benefits.;So much of politics and no healthy environment to work. No proper infrastructure to work and so many escalations but no one cares and the pathetic situation is appraisals time. I can't explain much.
1737;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;1.0;I just want to say please don't join Capgemini not only me almost all of us last 5 year's got appraisal as 0,1.5, 2,1.5,0 %. Even I got good ratings every year but no increments in salary last 5 years. Now you can say if no increments then why working with Capgemini? See as per Capgemini policy 90 days of notice period and non of company is ready to wait for it.;No increments in salary, 90 days of notice period.
1738;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;1.0;Learning opportunities;Terrible is an understatement for the kind of treatment or career growth at Capgemini. Lack of fairness, transparency, or ethics is just the beginning of the issues that the company has. Every department works in silos, some not even sure if or where their employees are physically located. One could easily get lost in the gaps and fo

1740;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;In Financial Services Domain : 1. Salaries paid on time, good compensations and shift allowance. 2. Excellent L&D system with free access to sites like Pluralsight. Most certifications are reimbursed. (Please make full use of this opportunity) 3. Onsite opportunities if you work well as most projects are Euorpean/US based.;1. Pay scale / promotions becomes stagnant after 2-3 years. 2. No transfers from one city/state to another on bench even for genuine cases. 3. If you get selected in campus placements, get ready to get transferred into another state.
1741;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;work life balance has been good for me. I have been able to devote some family time with a baby on the way. The management is way too weak I think and not able/willing to fight for the people in the lower pyramid.;The compensation part of it . To compare I have seen that my salary has annually growed at 4.5% in more than 5 years and considering the retail inflation rates its personally I see a degrowth for me.
1742;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;2.0;Group Medical Policy and work life balance.;Performance Management system is not up to mark. PMD session is hell. Few of the managers are also don't know about how to review the performance. To much politics in Project. Salary Hike is very poor.
1743;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;1.0;Work life balance is good. Apart from this nothing is good. Everything is in managers hand. No learning opportunities. No hike, no promotion.;"Lesser pay. Your hard work does not get appreciated. Management is bad. Only ""chaplus"" people get chance to go onsite. Also they get good hike with promotion."
1744;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Good for freshers if they got Development Projects. For Experienced People any project is good. There is no high pressure to employees from management most of the time.;Salary Appraisal is not good. only 30-40 percent of projects are on Development side, almost 50 percent of the projects are on Support side
1745;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Great Learning push. You can get plethora of materials and sources to learn and grow. Certification and training session.;Project allocation is just random. Company kneel down to serve the distasteful clients without taking care of employees. Many talent leave due to this. Typically *Desi* mindset of micromanagement.
1746;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Good trainings and facilities for employees;Nepotism, favouritism are at peak. Frequent Change in your supervisor and performance reviwers screwup your career growth
1747;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;Got 1 rating back to back just on my performance and promoted to next level within six months of getting my first project. Most of the people are nice and keeping it to themselves.;I had joined Capgemini as a fresher and spent 3 months in training an another 5-6 months on bench after training.

1750;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;The best (and worst thing) about Capgemini is, as a fresher, you could get tagged to any project. If you are lucky, you can land a great development project where you will learn a lot and get lots of support to grow. Capgemini invests a lot in their resources up-skilling, sponsoring lots of MOOQs and certifications which will help y;The notice period of 90 days is too long. Switching becomes tough since most recruiters won't wait 90 days for you to join them. Notice period cannot be relaxed even if you are on bench, it can only be bought out. Hikes are low, but to be fair the compensation is at par or better than other service-based IT companies.
1751;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;1.0;I joined Capgemini in May 2017 as senior associate. I put my best efforts as I want to grow because having financially issue. Shift timing start from 11:30 Am to 8:30 PM. Shuttle used to drop by 10:45 and I start working after reaching to office till 8:45 untill cab start to move. I also got good recognition and rating but when I rec;Written above
1752;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;In MNCs like CAP, you just can rate the company. Because your experience is totally based on the projects/accounts you are been associated with. But yes personally, i worked in Financial Services, Guidewire Technology to be specific. And i have worked a lot. And yes learnt a lot.;I did not find work life balance at all. Again i speak from my experience. Compensation and yearly hike is poor. So if you planning to join, i would suggest get the best deal in terms of compensation while you negotiate.
1753;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;I love the culture of the company, HR comes up with many different ideas for employee engagement and benefits. Work wise it has a very cool culture you will never feel suffocated here. Leadership, seniors, managers, teammates everyone here... But less financial growth.;Show financial growth.Sometimes you don't get appreciation for your work, no work life balance.

1756;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;It completely depends on which project you are working on.. but as a company work culture, policies , management it is supportive;%increment given in company is low. They should give that better which motivates employees to stay..
1757;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;It's really a good company. Gives the opportunity to employees. Company values your ideas irrespective of your position. Proud to be part of Capgemini.;Little work load & pressure. Varible pay is not there in Capgemini.
1758;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;The Company is open to innovation and readily adopts latest technology . I Love the fact that i am apart of a team that markets reliable , high-quality products and has a global Client base. Another Plus Point is that my colleagues come from various Cultural Backgrounds and we work happily in Collaboration. I also like the Empl;Compensation is decent , But growth is Slow, The work Pressure is very high Sometimes, I have to attend Clients calls in the evening and Sometimes late onto the night. Also there is no on- job training for freshers , hence Senior folks should take more responsible the training Areas, most of the time managers do not value an individuals ' Unique Strengths.
1759;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Dress Code policy, Inclusion, Projects & Learning Opportunities;Poor/average Performance ratings, Hierarchical Dominance, Poor HR policies, Uncertainty of Policies and limited benefits, Poor transport system and policies & timings.
1760;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;It totally depends upon the project, client and team you are working for, my experience was really good. Loved work culture, medical insurance and reward & recognition.;Exiting the company is bit confusing, nobody is aware whom to contact, where to inform when leaving the company. Anybody who desire to leave the company has to check with ex-employees for procedures. Pay could be better, it feels like getting peanuts for all the hard work we do.
1761;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Good work environment and culture. Teammates are supportive and the management is transparent. There is a huge cafeteria and gaming arcade for chilling.;Don't know
1762;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;I don't like work culture too much politics.. manager fever only those people who is follow only manager instructions only ..

No phycological safety , Promotions specific to few known people ( crying baby will get the milk)
1765;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Good place to work... But it always depends on the project you go into and on the management of perticular project.;Nothing in perticular to dislike about... there are not many fun times organised by capgemini during my tenure. Thats a big dissapointment. Rest.... it is ok.
1766;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;1.0;Hardly anythng;No training - just copy paste job job security - No security as project can over anytime No Career growth - i have team mates who are not given promotion from past 3-4 years Salary - appraisal is given 1- 2 % hike Politics - lot of politics, girl are favored who run behind their managers Learning - No learning - but still they w
1767;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;One of the best MNC company in world wide. While starting your career in this, you learn lot skill activities, Sap consultant.;People's were not placed in Project work, they will put in Bench. Even suppose got a project, they were assigned activities. But they can't give billable chance.
1768;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;The culture of work from home implemented nicely with one or other hiccups. There are no pressure of salary deduction and hike is also offered following the financial year. Provided home delivery of assets as a business continuation process. The asset team and the engineer team maintained that no issue is there while connecting to th;Should have adopted the change a little bit prior. But nonetheless great take over from company perspective.

1774;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Work life balance is very good.;On HR policies the notice period of this company is not favourable it is 3 months due to such long notice period I missed various opportunities.
1775;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Nothing specific but career growth and opportunities and skills development learning are two good things here.;Root level problem fixture is not there. Leadership behavior and thinking towards resources need to be soft, polite and professional.
1776;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;2.0;If you don't have commitments in life, guy with no carrier aspirations and not interested on Yearly hikes, just want monthly salary, CG is the place for you. You cannot expect more than this.;Workplace politics, not even a decent hike, terrible HR team.
1777;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;Job security is excellent until or unless we get any huge escalations several times. Work culture is good but should be having team spirit. When comes to management, can observe politics and those plays in compensation and benefits, promotions and hike. Capgemini is very stick to its policies at any cost.;Management Politics
1778;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Work culture, Job security, Diverse people;No hikes/perks/allowances/bonus etc. In short no money. Every year they find a new excuse why can't they give pay hikes.

Salary is decent but there is a problem the new joinees and experienced person salary are closely same. Incase of urgency We don't have backup to support business.
1780;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;Job security, work culture, management and company policy all are great.;Sometimes being a big organisation. You might feel left behind or less appreciated.
1781;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Nothing actually. I had joined this company with thoughts of growth and development and what i got in return was so much of unwanted work which makes no sense.;The environment, the kind of job they create, the kind of money they pay and most importantly no scope of growth or versatility.
1782;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;We will get more opportunities to enhance and improve our skills. Good Company culture.;Macro management in few business units. Need to struggle a bit for better work life balance.
1783;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Good company for job security;Monopoly of upper cast Pune ppl very difficult for others to get right growth if you are not from the lobby..

1785;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Work life balance is great, company has a great culture.;The fact that there are huge differences in rating and review process in different projects under capgemini, makes it difficult for some people in some projects. Skill development is very little.
1786;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;2.0;for a start, a good organisation to make your base strong, but low salary structure, less head counts for non billable process , higher number of working hours and no work life balance might become some factor for anyone to look for other options after a year;working culture and working hours. no salary normalisation policy. 3 months notice period ( non negotiable).
1787;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Job security and work life balance is good;Apart from your actual work, u have to handle other task such as asset management etc. Be aware before joining any project because once joined u can't easily removed, only option of resignation
1788;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;There will be opportunities for the developers and get to learn, teammates were nice. On the bench, we will get the live training on our profile.;No recognition, no matter how good you work, will get the poor hikes. Management should think about the employee's satisfaction. This is the only majority reason why people think about leaving the organization. If you couldn't get into the project, management will pressurize you to apply for resignation or relocate to a different location.
1789;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;Nothing much good to say;Salary is low when compared to the people working in the other company at the same designation. No incentives/variable pay for employees less than the manager level

1792;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;5.0;The kind of projects in pipeline is amazing. It provides an array of learning and upskilling opportunities. A company where self growth is given equal or more importance than company growth. According to me it is a perfect culmination of all its 7 principles.;Maybe a little more of employee benefits in the new normal WFH
1793;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;3.0;I have working here for 1 year and among that i was on 5 6 month bench. I am experienced candidates still was on bench until they sent me for client location. Management is weak. No proper communication with employees. Process is very frustrating.;Bad management, no communication, less career growth
1794;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;4.0;Flexible working hours, good work atmosphere, helpful seniors;Appraisal process now transparent, To deal with management is bit tedious.
1795;Consulting;Cap-Gemini;1.0;I hate working at Capgemini because the boss was evil and partial.

Good future and can learn n no of things.;Few process won't care about your health and virtual training is not good. They wil not let you settle down to work with comfort. You can't understand while you do it practically.

4973;Banking;HSBC;3.0;Job security is there;There is lot of politics and the management doesn't address our issues instead they focus more on micro management. No hikes at all career growth is very slow...if anyone resign from the organization then they wouldn't care at all.

4979;Banking;HSBC;3.0;I like how HSBC plans for the employee work-life balance. The motivation they provide fill in the spirits and hopes to many. People in the workplace are good. All the managers are same, they work together and are always on one word whether it is a good point or a bad one. I like the learning opportunities HSBC provide.;"If you want to grow with talent and technical skills, not a good place to choose. But if it is your communication skills as your strength then look for a job here. Opportunities are poor. Politics is high. Favouritism. Not the managers you want to work with. Work Execution is the part where it fails. It is, ""talk less, execute more""."
4980;Banking;HSBC;5.0;Work from home given is thankful to do job.as due to covid outside.rph is set after five months and considered from past means it's not fair.should set rph from start of the month itself.so that employees achieve their rph.placing people in action plan for not meeting Jan Feb on June is not fair as Apr and may when already met rph and quality.;Only one thing is placing action plan though met rph and quality saying ur down in rank due to bell curve.

4985;Banking;HSBC;2.0;Work ends on time most if the days;The management is unaware of educating their employees about the individual growth program.

6478;Technology;IBM;4.0;As a company IBM is one of the best companies in world. There is a great and huge opportunity to learn pretty much anything here.

7353;Technology;IBM;3.0;Work From Home;Salary Hikes
7354;Technology;IBM;3.0;Learning is very good.

In Ibm initial 6 months is the bonus periods for all the joiner with paid salary.;Salary/appraisal hike is very poor. They provide 4% to 6% hike. Even some year they dont provide the hike also.

7370;Technology;IBM;4.0;The company would be the perfect choice for those who aspire to have work-life balance. You can also do WFH(Work from home) here without much trouble but again it depends on the project as well. There are career opportunities and learning as well if you get a good project(client project). The work environment here is great.;Compensation is decent, but growth is slow. Don't expect much hike here as it may not result to be true.
7371;Technology;IBM;2.0;Learning portal;Poor People Management, most of First Line Managers (FLMs) are not properly trained and biased they favor localities, No Career progression despite having kills and getting selected for higher roles. Worst salary appraisals. no work-life balance.

Work under bengali only if you are bengali. Same with all managers. Manager is superior than HR. No one else to help u or support u, if u have to talk against ur manager.
7480;Technology;IBM;2.0;Job security and work life balance;Your growth depends on your manager....if you get a bad manager....you never grow...you will remain stagnant...all you can do is take a release and hope you end up with a good manager this time or switch...

7483;Technology;IBM;4.0;Below are subjective to the project to which the person is posted. Good environment to learn if self motivated. Company offers good flexibility to work from home/office and relaxed timings. Multiple resources are available free of cost to attain knowledge (O'Reilly, Some of the badges and courses in Your Learning site).;Below seems to be in general for all the projects as per my knowledge: Hike is pathetic. Only a promotion can give you good increase in salary, but a promotion is considered more like increased responsibility.
7484;Technology;IBM;4.0;Working culture is very good, but growth in terms of money is similar to other companies in the market available.;There is nothing to like or dislike.

10103;Banking;Morgan_Chase;5.0;The work life balance in my project is pretty good. Can opt for wfh as and when required. Work pressure never crosses a certain threshold since adequate resources are there. People are very helpful and you get to learn different application processes via continuous communication amongst the teams. Atleast I never got a chance to complain about my compensation, so on that sphere I‚Äôm satisfied.;Too many calls to attend and most of them based in US timezone.
